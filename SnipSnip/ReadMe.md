Truncates markdown-formatted content at X number of words (e.g., 50), and closes any open tags, so formatting does not affect "downwind" summaries.

Put file in `/site/addons/SnipSnip/` as `SnipSnipModifier.php`

Use as, e.g., `{{ content|snip_snip:50 }}{{# NB. ending ellipsis and [MORE] etc. edited w/in snip_snip itself  #}}`

Note that I DID NOT WRITE THE ORIGINAL, which was named `word_truncate`. I'd give credit to whoever did, if I could only remember where I got it!

Note also that I hacked the code to include my own ellipsis `…` and `[MORE]` code; so you should likewise modify it to suit YOUR OWN needs.

Code is provided AS-IS, without license, support, guarantee, warranty, or any of that stuff. You're on your own. I doubt I could help, in any case.
